# ICU Monitoring System(step down icu system for realtime analysis and monitoring)

Hosted Link had some linting issue (http://criticallink.vercel.app/) (http://criticallink.co/)-(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ILCLUyDT1CJ6zZyATbyxuIG7OVCBN9Z6/view?usp=sharing)
This project is a real-time ICU monitoring system, designed to enhance patient care by integrating multiple health data sources, advanced AI-powered monitoring, giving prediction based patients face emotions,body movement alerts, fall detection, Cough and sneeze detector, and remote access capabilities for healthcare teams.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Features

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Collects data from multiple medical devices.
- **AI-Based Monitoring**: Uses cameras and object detection to track patient activity.
- **Remote Access**: Mobile app for healthcare providers to monitor and make decisions remotely.
- **Alert System**: Instant notifications for abnormal readings or critical changes.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze historical data for tailored treatment plans.
- **Enhanced Communication**: Seamless interaction between healthcare teams and patient families.
- - **Enhanced Realtime alerting Mobile APP**: Seamless interaction between web and Android, sensor data transfer.

## Getting Started
extract and run server and medbit zip files in for server
Explore the project branches for additional configurations:
- **Server** branch: Contains backend configurations.
- **ML_config** branch: Houses machine learning configurations.

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the app by modifying `app/page.tsx`, with automatic updates on save.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) by Vercel.
